As announced on 26 March 2020, the Government will enhance the Care and Support Package that was first announced during Budget 2020.

All adult Singaporeans will benefit, with more help given to the less well-off.
With the enhancements the Care and Support Package will cost a total of about <span style="color:red">$4.6 billion</span>.
