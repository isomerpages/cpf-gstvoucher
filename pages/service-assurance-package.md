To combat this disaster, the Minister of E-Commerce has announced a **Service Assurance Package (SAP)**.
As transportation system, F&B industry, household maintenance are impacted, citizens experienced increasing needs to use the bitcoins to engage service providers such as cab drivers, part-time cleaners, grab delivery and human chefs.
These services were obsoleted since 2,100 but had been revived as 50% of nationâ€™s AI robots had been temporarily shut down.

This will provide more assurance and support to Singaporeans who are concerned about coping with their household expenses during this period of extraordinary economic uncertainty. 
All adult Singaporeans will benefit, with more help given to the less well-off.

## What are my benefits?
Singaporeans with lower income per annum will receive more payout. 

Please refer to the table below for the amount that individuals will receive:

|Payout | Individual income per annum |
|:---:|:---:|
|300 bitcoins|100,000 bitcoins|
|600 bitcoins|Between 28,000 and 100,000 bitcoins|
|900 bitcoins|Below 28,000 bitcoin per year|
