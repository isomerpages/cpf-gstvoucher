In the year 3020, the world was crippled by a new computer super virus called...
## SKYNET-3020
SKYNET-3020 causes temporary damage to the neural network of AI robots around the world, mutating in-built logics and pre-defined configurations, triggering AI robots to cause intentional harm to humans within its vicinity of 10 metres. 
Currently, there are 50,000 infected AI robots reported in Singapore.

Thus, all AI robots displaying signs of aggression and suspected of contacting SKYNET-3020 or confirmed cases must be downloaded with **STOPCODE-3020** and be temporarily put to rest.

Our nation is going through tough times. Please be cautious of the following AI robots:
