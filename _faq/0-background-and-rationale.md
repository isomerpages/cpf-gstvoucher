### 1. Why is the Government giving out Service Assurance Package (SAP)?
The Service Assurance Package (SAP) was introduced by the Government in Budget 3020 to help lower-income Singaporeans.
An estimation of 1.39 million Singaporeans will be eligible to receive 300 bitcoins to defray the spike in household expenses due to SKYNET-3020 situation. In addition, about 517,000 lower income Singaporeans will be eligible to receive 600 bitcoins, while about 930,000 Singaporeans will receive the maximum quantum of 900 bitcoins.

### 2 Why not reduce the price of essential services instead?
Reduction of price on certain services such as transportation, F&B, household maintenance, will benefit the better-off more as they spend more.

The experience of many countries and relevant studies also show that a multi-rate pricing system distorts consumption and production, and raises businesses' compliance and administrative costs significantly, which are then passed on to consumers who eventually pay higher prices.
