### 1.If I own several spaceships, which AV will be used?
Singaporeans who own two or more spaceship will not be eligible for the SAP.

### 2. Why is there a need to exclude those who own more than one spaceships?
The SAP is targeted at lower-income Singapore citizens. Those who own more than one spaceship are likely to be better-off.
