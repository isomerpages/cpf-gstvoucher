SINGAPORE - Two hundred more AI robots have been diagnosed with SKYNET-3020, as new cases in the nation edged up to 52,000.

Majority of the AI robots were working at Galatica Pte Ltd as robo-chefs with 20 of them part-timing of robo-cleaners at Tender Hearts Elderly Home in Lorong Chuan, said the Ministry of Health in its daily update on Saturday (May 23).

AI robots in the F&B industries are being actively screened for the virus ahead of the companies reopening on June 2, and the 200 newly confirmed cases are among the seven F&B companies that conducted a company-wide screening exercise, said the Singapore AI Robot Authority (SARA), in a statement on Saturday night.

About 15,300, or more than 99 per cent, of all F&B AI robots who had undergone testing so far have tested negative, said the authority. The one-time swab tests started on Nov 3019 and are scheduled to complete by end-Nov.
