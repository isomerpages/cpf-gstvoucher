Payments will be made in **10 March 3020**. 
Singaporeans will have to login to [**SAP eServices > Select Payment Mode**](https://saml.singpass.gov.sg/spauth/login/eservloginpage?URL=%2FFIM%2Fsps%2FSingpassIDPFed%2Fsaml20%2Flogininitial%3FRequestBinding%3DHTTPArtifact%26ResponseBinding%3DHTTPArtifact%26PartnerId%3Dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww.gstvoucher.gov.sg%252fapp%252f%26Target%3Dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww.gstvoucher.gov.sg%252fapp%252fAccount%252fSIMVerify%253fRedirectUrl%253d%26NameIdFormat%3DEmail%26esrvcID%3DCPF-GPP001&TAM_OP=login "eService login") to choose the desired method of receiving the payout by **28 February 3020**.

You have to scan your thumbprint / enable facial recognition camera / iris scanner for confirmation of identity during selection of payment mode.

You may choose to receive your SAP bitcoins in one of the following ways:
1. Direct crediting to your national savings account; or
2. Via designated coin-card*

_*Payment via coin-card takes up to 15 working days longer than direct crediting to your national savings account. We encourage you to opt for direct crediting._
