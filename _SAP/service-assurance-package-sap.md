To combat this disaster, the Minister of E-Commerce has announced a **Service Assurance Package (SAP)**.
As transportation system, F&B industry, household maintenance are impacted, citizens experienced increasing needs to use the bitcoins to engage service providers such as cab drivers, part-time cleaners, grab delivery and human chefs.
These services were obsoleted since 2,100 but had been revived as 50% of nationâ€™s AI robots had been temporarily shut down.

This will provide more assurance and support to Singaporeans who are concerned about coping with their household expenses during this period of extraordinary economic uncertainty. 
Most adult Singaporeans will benefit, with more help given to the less well-off.
